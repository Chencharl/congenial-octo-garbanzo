## Project Overview
This project uses a Custom ResNet model for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The model is trained using PyTorch, incorporating data augmentation, label smoothing, and learning rate scheduling for optimal performance. 
The goal is to maximize test accuracy while keeping the model under 5 million parameters.
